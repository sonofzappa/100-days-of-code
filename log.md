# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: September 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Went through the last two sections of FreeCodeCamps Responsive Web Design Lessons and finished the first project the "Tribute Page". I used Seung Sahn for fun after just finishing his book "Dropping Ashes' on the Buddah."

**Thoughts** Feel the site is a bit sloppy and looks rushed, which it was. Hard to keep code clean in small codepen window.

### Day 2: September 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Began the day working on the Free Code Camp Responive Survey challenge. I am going to use this as an oppurtunity to work on an online art workshop project I have been thinking about. Took a while to get the HTMl coded in, but once I did the CSS seemed easy, but I was indecisive on design. I should sketch something out latter and then rework it.

Finished the "Working With API's" section of Colt Steele's WDB. Some of the NPM and and express and request add ons are a bit confusing. The syntax for nodeJS is a bit overwhelming, but it seems to repeat a lot, so it should be easier I gain more experience. 

Some of the big lessons today:

JSON.parse(body) -> changes string into JSON format and is required to use info from JSONs when serving the info.


**Thoughts** I Love finally getting some insight into APIs, this seems to be the most leveraged part of development for data, which gives me plenty of new ideas to play with.
I need to continue to work on my CSS, my block, flexbox and layouts need some more work.

### Day 3: September 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
Reworked all of the Free Painting workshop survey site. It looks 110% better now! Reworked both the form and the styling. Used a color palette to help inform the colors and it really helped. Still using css and html. Today was mostly css. 

Watched and coded along with the colt Steele’s first section of yelp camp. It’s based on nodeJS. I’m building it on goormide. It’s my first server side project and it’s always a surprise when something posts or redirects correctly. 

Some of the big lessons today:
Focus on the repeatable bits you’ll have to remember but are struggling with. Ex:

Partials and listener also required apps(?)

App.post and app.get are different requests 

You pass in information as parameters from the app to the html 

**Thoughts** 
Still have so much to learn and get comfortable with. Seeing huge improvements and leaps in knowledge every day. Can wait to see what I am working on by the end of the week.
