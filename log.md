**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: September 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Went through the last two sections of FreeCodeCamps Responsive Web Design Lessons and finished the first project the "Tribute Page". I used Seung Sahn for fun after just finishing his book "Dropping Ashes' on the Buddah."

**Thoughts** Feel the site is a bit sloppy and looks rushed, which it was. Hard to keep code clean in small codepen window.
