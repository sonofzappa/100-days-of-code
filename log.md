# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: September 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Went through the last two sections of FreeCodeCamps Responsive Web Design Lessons and finished the first project the "Tribute Page". I used Seung Sahn for fun after just finishing his book "Dropping Ashes' on the Buddah."

**Thoughts** Feel the site is a bit sloppy and looks rushed, which it was. Hard to keep code clean in small codepen window.

### Day 2: September 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Began the day working on the Free Code Camp Responive Survey challenge. I am going to use this as an oppurtunity to work on an online art workshop project I have been thinking about. Took a while to get the HTMl coded in, but once I did the CSS seemed easy, but I was indecisive on design. I should sketch something out latter and then rework it.

Finished the "Working With API's" section of Colt Steele's WDB. Some of the NPM and and express and request add ons are a bit confusing. The syntax for nodeJS is a bit overwhelming, but it seems to repeat a lot, so it should be easier I gain more experience. 

Some of the big lessons today:

JSON.parse(body) -> changes string into JSON format and is required to use info from JSONs when serving the info.


**Thoughts** I Love finally getting some insight into APIs, this seems to be the most leveraged part of development for data, which gives me plenty of new ideas to play with.
I need to continue to work on my CSS, my block, flexbox and layouts need some more work.

### Day 3: September 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
Reworked all of the Free Painting workshop survey site. It looks 110% better now! Reworked both the form and the styling. Used a color palette to help inform the colors and it really helped. Still using css and html. Today was mostly css. 

Watched and coded along with the colt Steele’s first section of yelp camp. It’s based on nodeJS. I’m building it on goormide. It’s my first server side project and it’s always a surprise when something posts or redirects correctly. 

Some of the big lessons today:
Focus on the repeatable bits you’ll have to remember but are struggling with. Ex:

Partials and listener also required apps(?)

App.post and app.get are different requests 

You pass in information as parameters from the app to the html 

**Thoughts** 
Still have so much to learn and get comfortable with. Seeing huge improvements and leaps in knowledge every day. Can wait to see what I am working on by the end of the week.

### Day 4: September 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
Began the FCC challenge for a landing page on for a fake flower shop. I used HTML, CSS and bootstrap to begin the layout which still needs a lot of work, but I should be able to wrap it up tomorrow. 
Also watched the intro to Databases/ Mongodb on Colt Steeles WDB course. I got frustrated when my server stopped running and I couldn't make my way back in and retrieve what I had been working on. It will only take a 10 minutes to re-do my work, but it was frustrating enough I decided to move over to the FCC project.

**Some of the big lessons today:**
Databases:
*A collection of data/ information
*Has and interface (you can write code to interact with it)

SQL(relational) vs. NoSQL(relational)
* relational - follows a table structure. a.k.a. flt
* requires join tables to put together multiple pieces of info.
* difficult to add new items to data sets since all must be the same structure
NoSQL(non-relational)
* info can be nested
* basically  JSON
* key-value pairs

**Thoughts** 
Bootstrap made creating the start of a page much quicker, but also feels like a cop-out. But it is good to keep in practice. I am very curious how all this back end stuff fits together and what I will be able to do with it in the long wrong.

### Day 5: September 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
Worked with HTML, Bootstrap and CSS on the landing page project again. Got Mongo and Mongoose running via WDB. Looking forward to putting it into practice tomorrow.

**Some of the big lessons today:**
Mongoose is a way to store databases on a server mongo is the language used to create it.

**Thoughts** 
Still having some trouble getting everything to align as I predict when I go to style elements. This is by far my weak suit for now.

### Day 6: September 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
Finished the flower shop on code pen and got it approved. Worked on Yelp Camp MongoDB.

**Some of the big lessons today:**
Be patient. Check your spelling.

**Thoughts** 
Need to figure out the listening issue on the server. Not sure if it was something on my end or random.
